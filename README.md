# Jumper DIY Drone Build Documentation

This README.md provides a overview of my DIY drone build project from 2014 to 2015, which had been a pivotal experience. The project traces the evolution of the drone, from its initial 3D-printed frame to the carbon fibre frame. The objective of this documentation is to share my journey, insights, and lessons learned with the DIY drone community.

## Project Overview

The DIY drone project commenced in 2015 as an exploration of drones and the merging of mechanical and electronic components. The project's has several key phases:

1. **3D Printing the Frame Design**: The project originated with the discovery of 3D-printed drone frames on Thingiverse. The chosen model, available at [this link](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:34552), formed the foundation for the initial build.

2. **Designing a Custom Frame**: The limitations of the 3D-printed frame led to the pursuit of a custom frame design. This phase involved overcoming challenges and acquiring valuable design experience.

3. **Transition to Carbon Fiber**: Recognizing the advantages of carbon fiber frames, a transition was made to a Jumper 266 frame from HobbyKing.

4. **Incorporating FPV**: The project's progression included the integration of First-Person View (FPV) capabilities, enhancing the drone's remote operation.

## Project Details

### Initial 3D-Printed Frame

The project's inception involved the 3D printing of a drone frame sourced from Thingiverse. The advantages of this approach included customization and affordability. However, challenges such as fragility and the need for supplementary parts were encountered. The acquired experience laid the groundwork for future design endeavors. The drone did fly, but not without difficulty. 

### Custom Frame Design

Recognizing the limitations of the 3D-printed frame, I embarked on designing a custom frame. This phase was my first endevour doing mechanical design using CAD software, using 123D Design. The resulting frame aimed to address the shortcomings of the initial design and was a H-type of frame. The main electronic are stored in the compartment with the battery on top.

### Transition to Carbon Fiber

A  decision was made to transition from a 3D-printed frame to a carbon fiber frame (Jumper 266). This upgrade offered increased durability, stability, and potential for expansion. The assembly process involved attaching motors, ESCs, and the flight controller, which remained at the core of the drone's architecture. Additionally a mobius camera was added to get in flight footage.

### Incorporating FPV

The project's evolution included the integration of FPV capabilities, enabling remote piloting of the drone. This involved mounting a camera, transmitter, and receiver/LCD system. The FPV setup allowed for improved control and maneuverability, expanding the scope of the drone's applications.

## Components Used

Throughout the project, the following components were utilized:

- Motors: Scorpion M2205-2360k
- Flight Controller: SP F3 Acro (later upgraded to Deluxe version for autonomous features)
- ESCs: Lumenier Mini 20A ESC with Autoshot SimonK
- Camera: Mobius
- Batteries: 2200mAh 3S 35C and 1300mAh 4S 45C
- Transmitter: Flysky i10
- GPS Module: uBlox M8N (utilized with iNav firmware for improved GPS capabilities)

## Acknowledgments

This project has been a journey of exploration, learning, and innovation. It would not have been possible without the support, guidance, and inspiration from fellow DIY enthusiasts and the online drone community.
